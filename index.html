      <h2>NurFauzan</h2>
      <p>
        Heyyo, welcome. This is my website, made in march 2020 and finished in june 2021. This is not a website template, made it by myself  using html, css, javascript and bootsrap 5. I learn from youtube and other online sites. Of course it's quite difficult to make this simple website, repeatedly tried and uploaded it online, but there are just an sintaks error problem. Trying to the edge find an way aesthetic. This isn't a web portfolio, and I'm not going to say much about myself because it's so disgusting. Y'all narcissistic prick, So fuck you if you think I'm doing shit for fame. everybody tryna roleplay all persona the don't fucking have.
        <br><br>
        living in the negativ city which i like lately. Seeing conservative moms gossiping. Now I'm fucking upset. i've seen enough. Made a deal with fiend that lets me live to the fullest, Get the report when the game's fuckin' over.the demon gotta be right by my side for the rest of my life. Y'all think this about my feelings? Fuck it up, kiddos live it up. When the sun goes down I hope it would turn in the west, I'mma wait till the fairy tale comes true. So please for the love of God, don't "punish" me. Fuckin leader who does not have nationalism, They still think this about my feelings? eww, i dont care about this country anymore.
        <br><br>
        They say I'm elitist, like better than a horse, good hunch kids. I got these shit wailing like the Javanese, give it up makin' choices. "Oh hey, this is bogay!" that's all they say about bogor boys who looking gay. This is some fucking bullshit. what did the jew clown do?I can't answer at the moment, I got thumb in my mouth
        ,My mouth, thumb in my mouth. My grammar sucks, that's why I always have a dictionary on my phone. I'm not a fuckin' seleb with a lot of chicks. I'm just chilling making website everyday, I'm a simple man, I don't need a macOS. 
        <br><br>
        making  jokes, make of love, there's no compromise. it's my life, I'm so high, get it right, I don't care, i just ride, let it ride. I'm shocked when I was stupid. Young boy with the trash talk, he said "oh wow, you really know your stuff". No faggot kid, but seriously I'm getting faded in your life. when you are with a woman you are like a monster. yeah, no one can defeat you, hey fuck u meeh. i have beautiful women and i tell you they're never wrong. Oh yeah, she bring my straight back. look ,got em, fuck, running, yeah. Been the horse and you knew that there make hand disappear, how krautz do that there? trying to get out of the ghetto? they just apply the "final solution".
        <br><br> 
        -- what I wrote was only my anxiety about society, If anyone is offended maybe I will close this website.this is part of gift of gab/freedom of speech, freedom of expression, free will, bet you never seen zan like this? so what you trying to say about my yeller --
        <br><br>

      <h4>SordWallace</h4>
      <p>
        maybe some of you who know me are already familiar with sord. i use it for in-game id. sord is a person's name, his real name is sordwallace. we started to know and be friends in 2019. through a strange game called growtopia, he is my online friend or first friend from canada. he is a good person, taught me various things about framework and helped me in making this website. I use English because sord doesn't understand Indonesian, he has helped me make this website. he always talks about his country being peaceful and upholding the freedom of human rights, which I also really want such a country. he is also very humble to me.
      </p>

      <h4>About Game</h4>
      <p>
        I still don't know much about making games. I didn't make this game, I copied it from Fariat. can't be played on mobile, it can only be played on a computer or on a desktop, but I will try to make buttons to move the game. so that visitors don't get bored I put this game on my website and add to the experience of visitors when visiting my website. I will give credit : <a href="https://codepen.io/fariati/pen/mdRpEYP">source...</a>
